 <h3 align="center"> Introduction </h3>

<p align="center"> This tongue in cheek project was created by Sheldon Burke to train Alexnet using Colab to discern between Kim Jong Un and Kim Jong IL. As a former history major and now a current student in Data Science and Analytics, I want to marry my love of history with my newfound love of Artifical Intelligence.

 <h3 align="center"> Context </h3>

<p align="center">
 
 <b> Sheldon Burke </b> is a Librarian and a current student pursuring his second bachelors in Data Science and Analytics with a focus on Business Analytics and a certificate in Artifical Intelligence. 

 <b> Kim Jong IL </b> Aka the Dear leader and Former leader of the "Best Korea."

 <b> Kim Jong Un </b> "The Great Successor" and "Supreme Leader." Son of Kim Jong IL and bff of Denis Rodman and Donald Trump. (It's wild to even type that sentence).


<h3 align="center"> Tools </h3>

<b> AlexNet </b> is a deep neural network architecture developed by researchers led by Alex Krizhevsky in 2012. It has eight layers including five convolution layers, two fully connected layers, and softmax layer.

<b> Torchvision </b> is used for manipulation of images in dataset.

<b> Google Colab </b> a free software through Google that uses Python.

<b> Google Drive </b> a somewhat free cloud storage service from Google which houses our datasets.

<h3 align="center"> Problem that this solves </h3>

26 million people live in North Korea at the time of this project. I can assure you that confusing the Dear Leader with the Great Leader is a matter of life and death. The stakes do not get any higher than that. This test project will prevent the hardworking of North Korea from mistaking the Father Generalissmo with the Worker's Party of Korea's General secretary and President of the State Affairs--Kim Jong Un.

Through our testing, we were able to get our model's accuracy up to 90%. To improve on this, it is likely we will need a larger dataset of photos of both leaders, however that proves difficult as Kim Jong Il unlike his son does not have a trove of photographs. Considering the age in which he grew up in, and the isolation of North Korean this is not surprising. The dataset we have is compartively small compared to most training dataset which usually run in the hundreds if not thousands.

Still, when we placed the photo below into our AlexNet model, this model accurately came to the conclusion that this was Kim Jong UN

The model does require some work however, as we have described above, for example it mistakes this photo of Kim Jong Il for Kim Jong UN. Given Kim Jong Il's fashion, his proclivity to wear army green and us only having one image of Kim Jong Un wearing green, it is hard for my fleshy, human mind to see how it came to this conclusion, otherwise than perhaps face proportion.

Still, even so, I am very happy with the work so far and may work in my spare time to improve this model for the fun of it all. Though the model is not nearly as accurate as I would like, I am as happy as a North Korean newscaster reporting the launch of a Hwasong-17 missle test to stunt on imperialist swines who are permenant enemies of the "Democratic" People's Republic of Korea.
