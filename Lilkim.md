*Kim Jong IL

Aka the Dear leaderand Former leader of the "Best Korea."

*Kim Jong Un

"The Great Successor" and "Supreme Leader." Son of Kim Jong IL and bff of Denis Rodman and Donald Trump. (It's wild to even type that sentence).

*Google Colab

Problem that this solves

26 million people live in North Korea at the time of this project. I can assure you that confusing the Dear Leader with the Great Leader is a matter of life and death. The stakes do not get any higher than that.
